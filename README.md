# Portofolio Website
Here if you have a note, leave it here:

just ignore the .vscode folder
if there a media like image or something, just drop it in the design and media file
also drop the desing there :)
the actual website will be in the TheWebsite folder. if the website are ready, we just need to 
drag and drop TheWebsite folder to the hosting server
